Also, provide suggestions and code examples (using Tailwind CSS and Shadcn UI components) to enhance the UI/UX of the Project card in ProjectList.tsx, making it more modern and visually appealing. Consider these best practices from perplexity research: use i18n library like react-i18next (or a simpler map if sufficient), ensure text expansion space, maintain color semantics, improve visual hierarchy (contrast, typography), consider progressive disclosure, maybe add subtle icons or progress indicators if relevant, and use skeleton loading. The goal is a cleaner, more informative card display.'
